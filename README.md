## Customizing Vim ✨

### 1. **.vimrc**

Create a `.vimrc` file in your home directory to personalize Vim:
```vim
" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on

" Show line numbers
set number

" Enable auto-indentation
set autoindent
set smartindent

" Set tabs to spaces
set expandtab
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
```

### 2. **Plugins**

Use a plugin manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

1. Install vim-plug:
   ```bash
   curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
   ```

2. Add plugins to your `.vimrc`:
   ```vim
   call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

   " Example plugins
   Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'       " File explorer
   Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
   Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'  " Git integration

   call plug#end()
   ```

3. Install plugins in Vim:
   ```vim
   :PlugInstall
   ```
